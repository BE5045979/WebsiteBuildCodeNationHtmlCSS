        When making a website there are certain file types that tend to better for use such as;
        Images that are lower size would be alot better to use as it takes a lot less time to load them and reduces the overall size of the website. Suitable file types are:
        <br><br>
        GIF (smaller size than others, great for creating banners as they can hold text and transparent backgrounds. A lower color palette however than other file types.)
        <br><br>
        PNG  (“PNG-8s are capable of containing a maximum of 256 colours whereas a PNG-24 can contain an unlimited amount of colours. This means they are not just suitable for images, but also graphics and text. PNGs also give you control over transparency, unlike JPEGs, which makes them pretty much perfect for logos. PNGs also use a lossless compression, meaning they don’t lose any information or quality.”)[2]
        <br><br>
        JPEG (“JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on pagespeed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as an 8MB image as its smaller size means it requires less resources to load”.)[2]
        <br><br>
        Vector (This filetype, normally saved a SVG are perfect for graphics that require resizing a lot for icons and logos.
        “SVGs do not require any HTML requests and will, therefore, improve page speed. This also means that SVGs are great for creating logos that will be used on different screen sizes and resolutions.
        Another thing to remember about SVGs is that they can be animated too; they’re very similar to GIFs, except for the fact that they are vector based, not raster”[3].)
        <br><br>
        With videos, using embedded youtube videos tend to be a common practise on a lot of sites however if you want more control over the video player there are a few types of video file that will be suited for the web.
        MP4 (my preference and supported by HTML 5 this file format is great for websites but due to its age isn't the best fit for modern websites or future ones)[4]
        <br><br>
        OGV (A redesigned OGG format for online streaming. Its age means it's no longer supported by Internet Explorer or Safari browsers but is still a good choice for low file size video content.
        <br><br>
        WebM (tHIS IS an open source video format which is suitable for modern and future internet browsers.
        “It delivers the highest quality video it can in real time, adjusting file weight depending on connection and processing power. Despite its recent development and release, however, WebM (currently) has the same HTML5 browser incompatibilities as OGV (WebM’s one advantage being its compatibility with Chrome on Android devices)”[5]
        <br><br>
        WebVTT
        “Similar to the WebM format, WebVTT was released in 2010 with the hope of overtaking all other video formats used on the web. WebVTT’s greatest advantage over its competitors is that WebVTT was developed by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium). WebVTT was created directly from W3C’s own HTML standard, making it the most compatible video tag format (currently) available. The cross operating system and cross browser support that WebVTT offers makes it the logical choice for videos on any website.”[5]
        There are many more video formats than the ones mentioned, the idea is to use a file type that causes no issues with your site or at least less.
